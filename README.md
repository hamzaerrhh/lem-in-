# lem-in🐜

this project help you with the algoritme 
the main object understabd
--dfs
--new structure de donné graphe  
--optimising


## 1 graphe data structure
```
in the lemi-in prject we should get the shourt pate between 2 speciale nodes nose have a tunnel between them (have the same value 1 in this project)
so the graphe data struvture containe
-graph G (our coulounie)
-node (room in our project)
-tunnel (room1-room2)
-special node (start,end)
```
## parsing
```
first step of each project is understanding the project
so we should get our coulounie in struct to doi our logic in it
this is the parding 
```
## struct of graph

## algorithme fin path with the minimal shared room BFS
 ```
in usaly when we have a graph and we wanna find shortest path we use djikstra(find the short path by calculating the cost of tunnel )
**Weighted**
```
but in this project when all path cost the same we will use a sample BFS "unWeighted"
